!  This subroutine generates the subsets of size K from a set of size N.

!    ISBN 0-12-519260-6.
!
!  Parameters:
!
!    Input, integer N, the size of the set from which subsets are drawn.
!
!    Input, integer K, the desired size of the subsets.  K must
!    be between 0 and N.
!
!    Input/output, integer A(K).  A(I) is the I-th element of the
!    subset.  Thus A(I) will be an integer between 1 and N.
!    Note that the routine will return the values in A
!    in sorted order: 1 <= A(1) < A(2) < ... < A(K) <= N
!
!    Input/output, logical MORE.  Set MORE = FALSE before first call
!    for a new sequence of subsets.  It then is set and remains
!    TRUE as long as the subset computed on this call is not the
!    final one.  When the final subset is computed, MORE is set to
!    FALSE as a signal that the computation is done.
