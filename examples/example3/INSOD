# FILER, MAPPER
# FILER:   0 (no calc files generated), 1 (GULP), 2 (METADISE), 11 (VASP), 12 (CASTEP)
# MAPPER:  0 (no mapping, use currect structure), >0 (map to structure in MAPTO file)
# (each position in old structure is mapped to MAPPER positions in new structure)
11 0

# If FILER=1 then: 
# ishell(1:nsp) 0 core only / 1 core and shell (for the species listed in symbol(1:nsp)) 
0 0 
# newshell(1:2) 0 core only / 1 core and shell (for the species listed in newsymbol(1:2))
